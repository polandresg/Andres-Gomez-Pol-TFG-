This projects aim is to develop a non-invasive system to monitor marine biodiversity.
It captures real-time video from two 180ยบ fisheye cameras (forming a 360ยบ view) via RTSP, then transforms the imagery into an equirectangular projection, detects marine species using a YOLOv8 model, and streams the final processed video to YouTube Live via RTMP.
